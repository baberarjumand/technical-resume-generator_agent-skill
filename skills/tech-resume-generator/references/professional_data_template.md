# Professional data template

Write `output/professional_data.md` in this shape after extracting `user_data/`. Fill only with facts found in the user’s files. Use `Unknown` or omit a subsection when evidence is missing — never invent.

```markdown
# Professional data — <Full Name>

Compiled: <ISO date>
Sources: <list of files used>
Precedence: official docs > LinkedIn timeline > old resume wording > notes

## 1. Identity and public profiles

Do **not** put street address, photo, DOB, or government IDs on the résumé even if present here.

## 2. Professional summaries (raw)

Paste or paraphrase existing About / summary text from LinkedIn or old resumes for reference. Do not ship these paragraphs verbatim on the one-pager unless shortened to a TIH-style headline.

For each role:

### <Title> — <Company> (<Start> – <End>)
