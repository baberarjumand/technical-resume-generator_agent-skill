name: tech-resume-generator
description: >-
  Use this skill when the user wants to create, rewrite, optimize, or tailor a
  technical / SWE / engineering resume or CV from career materials (old resumes,
  LinkedIn exports, PDFs, images, Markdown, certs, or notes)—including casual
  asks like "make my resume better," "ATS-friendly," "one-pager for internships,"
  or "customize this for a job posting." Workspace I/O lives under
  tech-resume-generator_files/{user_professional_data,job_description_data,output}/
  (not user_data/). Produces a one-page ATS-safe tech resume as JSON + PDF
  (general or JD-tailored). Do not use for cover letters alone, LinkedIn profile
  rewrites, recruiter cold emails, interview prep, or non-tech CVs unless the
  user also wants a tech resume.
license: MIT
compatibility: >-
  Requires Node.js 18+ and `npm install` inside this skill directory (pdf-lib).
  Optional: Python 3, poppler-utils (pdftotext/pdfinfo/pdftoppm), Pillow for PDF
  text extraction. Works in any Agent Skills–compatible client.

# Tech Resume Generator

## Detect environment (required first)

There is no automatic browser/repo flag. **Probe once**, then follow the matching workflow.

1. Try to bootstrap the workspace (repo probe):

```bash
node scripts/init_workspace.mjs --workspace <workspace-root>
# After project install (from the user's project root):
node .agents/skills/tech-resume-generator/scripts/init_workspace.mjs
# or:
node .cursor/skills/tech-resume-generator/scripts/init_workspace.mjs
```

2. **If that succeeds** (folder `tech-resume-generator_files/` exists with the three subfolders) → use the **Repo workflow** below.
3. **If it fails** (no shell, no writable project root, sandbox blocked, or similar) → use the **Browser workflow** below. Do **not** keep retrying init.

Also treat as **browser** when the user only has chat uploads and no project filesystem.

---

## Repo workflow

### Workspace layout

At the **project / workspace root** (not inside this skill folder):

```
tech-resume-generator_files/
  user_professional_data/   # career materials (input)
  job_description_data/     # job postings (JD-tailored mode)
  output/                   # generated JSON + PDF + professional_data.md
```

`init_workspace.mjs` creates these folders and a `README.md` in each (does not overwrite existing READMEs).  
**Do not use a legacy `user_data/` folder** — inputs and outputs belong under `tech-resume-generator_files/` only.

### Ask first (required)

Before reading files, ask:

> Do you want a **general** optimized tech resume, or a resume **tailored to a job description**?

Then confirm the workspace folders (created by `init_workspace.mjs` at the **workspace root**, sibling to where this skill is installed—not inside the skill folder):

| Folder | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `tech-resume-generator_files/user_professional_data/` | Career materials (resumes, LinkedIn, certs, notes) |
| `tech-resume-generator_files/job_description_data/` | Job postings for JD-tailored mode |
| `tech-resume-generator_files/output/` | Generated `professional_data.md`, résumé JSON, and PDFs |

If **JD-tailored** and no JD is present yet, ask how they will provide it:

- paste into chat (then save under `tech-resume-generator_files/job_description_data/`), or
- add one or more files under `tech-resume-generator_files/job_description_data/` (e.g. `job_description.md`, `.txt`, `.pdf`, or multiple postings)

Do not invent a target role or JD.

### Checklist

```
Resume generation (repo):
- [ ] init_workspace succeeded → tech-resume-generator_files/ present
- [ ] Mode chosen (general | JD-tailored)
- [ ] JD obtained if tailored (job_description_data/)
- [ ] user_professional_data/ inventoried
- [ ] Extraction complete (or new extractors written)
- [ ] tech-resume-generator_files/output/professional_data.md compiled
- [ ] Resume JSON written under output/general or output/tailored
- [ ] PDF rendered; overflow fixed
- [ ] Paths delivered to user
```

### Input contract

- Career files: `tech-resume-generator_files/user_professional_data/` (any mix of `.md`, `.txt`, `.pdf`, images, `.docx`, `.json`, `.ts`, LinkedIn exports, certs, notes). Subfolders OK. **Do not skip unknown files.**
- Job postings: `tech-resume-generator_files/job_description_data/`
- Details: [references/user_data_contract.md](references/user_data_contract.md). Examples: [references/usage_examples.md](references/usage_examples.md).

### Available scripts

Paths are relative to this skill directory. Data folders live under workspace `tech-resume-generator_files/`.

| Script | When to run |
| --- | --- |
| `scripts/init_workspace.mjs` | **First** — create `tech-resume-generator_files/{user_professional_data,job_description_data,output}/` |
| `scripts/extract_user_data.py` | Inventory + extract `user_professional_data/` |
| `scripts/generate_resume_pdf.mjs` | After writing resume JSON — render sibling `.pdf` |
| `scripts/eval_grade.py` / `eval_aggregate.py` | Eval suite |
| `scripts/download_sample_resumes.py` | Optional samples |
| `scripts/extractors/<format>_extract.py` | Unsupported formats |

### Steps

#### 1. Inventory and extract

```bash
python3 scripts/extract_user_data.py \
  --input <workspace>/tech-resume-generator_files/user_professional_data \
  --output <workspace>/tech-resume-generator_files/user_professional_data/_extracted
```

**Unknown formats:** write `scripts/extractors/<format>_extract.py`, run it, continue. Never drop a file.

#### 2. Compile professional data

Write `<workspace>/tech-resume-generator_files/output/professional_data.md` using [references/professional_data_template.md](references/professional_data_template.md).

- Facts only — never invent employers, titles, dates, tools, metrics, or credentials.
- Reconcile conflicts: official docs > LinkedIn timeline > old resume wording.
- Identity comes **only** from the user’s files.
- Omit street address, photo, DOB from the résumé even if present in sources.

#### 3. Optimize (load references on demand)

**Always** read [references/resume_guidelines/99_cross-source-rules.md](references/resume_guidelines/99_cross-source-rules.md) before authoring.

Then load **only** what the case needs:

- Student / &lt;~3 YoE → `01_`, `08_`, `10_`, `18_`
- Experienced SWE → `06_`, `07_`, `11_`, `21_`
- Optional samples → `assets/sample_resumes/` (never copy content)
- Bullet formulas → `16_`, `12_`, `15_`
- JSON → [references/json_schema.md](references/json_schema.md) + [assets/templates/resume_example.json](assets/templates/resume_example.json)

**Defaults (experienced industry SWE):** one page, ≥0.5" margins, single column, Helvetica/Arial/Calibri; skills → experience → education; ownership verb + tech + metric; JD mode = true keywords only.

#### 4. Author resume JSON

- General: `tech-resume-generator_files/output/general/<slug>_resume.json`
- Tailored: `tech-resume-generator_files/output/tailored/<job-slug>/<slug>_resume.json`

#### 5. Render PDF

```bash
npm install   # once, in this skill directory
node scripts/generate_resume_pdf.mjs <path-to-resume.json>
```

Fix layout overflow until the page fits.

#### 6. Deliver

Report paths under `tech-resume-generator_files/output/`.

## Browser workflow

Use when `init_workspace.mjs` fails or there is no project filesystem.

1. Ask **general vs JD-tailored** (same as repo).
2. Ask the user to **upload/attach** career files (and JD if tailored) in chat — there is no `tech-resume-generator_files/` folder.
3. Compile facts and produce résumé **JSON** and/or **Markdown** in the conversation (and downloadable artifacts if the host allows).
4. If PDF cannot be rendered in-chat, tell the user to save the JSON and run locally:

```bash
node scripts/generate_resume_pdf.mjs path/to/resume.json
```

5. Still never invent metrics/employers; still one-page ATS rules.

## Evaluation (core — not optional)

Follow [Evaluating skill output quality](https://agentskills.io/skill-creation/evaluating-skills). When evaluating this skill:

1. Read [evals/evals.json](evals/evals.json) and fixtures under [evals/files/](evals/files/).
2. Write artifacts to `evals-workspace/iteration-N/eval-<slug>/with_skill/outputs/` (same shape as `tech-resume-generator_files/output/`).
3. Grade with `scripts/eval_grade.py`; aggregate with `scripts/eval_aggregate.py`.
4. Description triggers: [evals/trigger_queries.json](evals/trigger_queries.json).

Details: [evals/README.md](evals/README.md).

## Gotchas

- **Do not invent metrics or tools.**
- **Sample resumes are optional references, not content.**
- **Section order depends on seniority** (students may put education first).
- **`tech-resume-generator_files/` is outside the skill folder** so installs stay read-only-friendly.
- **Script paths are skill-relative**; workspace paths are under the project root.
- **`.docx` is not auto-extracted** — write an extractor when needed.
- After `npx skills add`, run `npm install` inside the skill directory before PDF rendering.

## Hard constraints

- No invented certifications, tools, metrics, or employers
- No street address, photo, DOB, or Expert/Beginner proficiency labels on the résumé
- One page for industry SWE unless the user explicitly needs an academic CV / AU 2-page CV
